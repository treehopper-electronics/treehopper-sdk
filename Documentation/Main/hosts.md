\page hosts Supported Hosts
All Treehopper APIs are designed to run on USB-equipped hosts -- you can't program a Treehopper board to act on its own when disconnected from a computer (unless you want to do \ref native-development). This page goes over host requirements, and provides a few examples of supported devices. We provide some platform-specific instructions on our \ref getting-started pages.

# Desktop and Laptop Computers {#desktop}
Treehopper supports essentially all desktops and laptops with USB ports. The only software requirements are that the device runs either:
 - <b>Windows 7 or newer.</b> This is needed for automatic WinUSB installation, but an adventurous user may be able to get older Windows systems working.
 - <b>Some form of LibUSB-supported operating system.</b> All Treehopper language APIs use LibUSB in non-Windows systems for USB interfacing. *We regularly test on Linux and macOS, but LibUSB also supports OpenBSD, NetBSD, and FreeBSD, so our libraries should work there, too.*
 - <b>Android Lollipop or higher</b>.

# Embedded Devices {#embedded-linux}
Many embedded devices running Linux or Windows can be used with Treehopper. The [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) is one such device, and, when running Linux, it works well as a host for apps that use Treehopper -- whether written in C# (via mono), Java, or C++. We also support Raspberry Pi under [Windows 10 IoT Core](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot/explore/iotcore) through our C# UWP API.

Even low-cost OpenWRT-powered routers should be able to run Treehopper apps written in C++ (though probably not C# or Java).

# Windows tablets, phones, and set-top-boxes {#windows-tablets-phones}
Most Windows tablets work great for running Treehopper projects, as nearly all of them have USB OTG support. While there were a few WinRT tablets running an ARM version of Windows, all current-generation Windows 10 tablets on the market use Intel Atom processors and run the full x86-based version of Windows. This means they can be used with all the Treehopper language APIs seamlessly -- C# Desktop, Windows UWP, Java, or C++. And since these tablets are the same architecture as your desktop or laptop computer, you can literally drag-and-drop apps -- even ones written in native C++ -- from your computer to the tablet to deploy. 

An emerging category of device is the Windows 10 set-top-box and the Windows 10 compute stick form-factors. We regularly test with various offerings from [MeeGoPad](http://www.x86pad.com/), [Wintel](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06W2LWQKC), and [Intel](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/compute-stick/intel-compute-stick.html).

Of all the Microsoft Lumia phones on the market, only the Lumia 950 and 950 XL support the USB OTG role needed to run Treehopper. Some phones from other manufacturers with USB OTG functionality include the Alcatel Idol 4S, HP Elite X3, and CUBE WP10.

# Android Tablets, Smartphones, and Set-top-boxes {#android}
Any Android device running Lollipop (5.0 -- "API Level 21" in developer speak) with USB Host capability can run Treehopper (note that on devices that charge through their USB port, this might be referred to as "USB OTG Support"). Almost all high-end devices have this functionality, and many newer lower-end and middle-tier devices can also serve as USB hosts. 

Unfortunately, this feature is often not prominently advertised, and it can vary by carrier or hardware revision --- even on devices that are otherwise identical. If you want to check the devices you already own, there are several apps on the Google Play Store that do this. We've tried both [OTG?](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.btssm.doihaveotg&hl=en) and [USB Host Diagnostics](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.chainfire.usbhostdiagnostics&hl=en).

If you're device shopping, researching "USB Host" or "USB OTG" support with your device model number (and carrier) can often lead to useful information. 

Many users are looking for low-cost devices they can permanently use in their projects. Any device with USB host support, running Android 5.0 or later, will work. And because we get asked this all the time: you don't need to have the phone activated to be able to use it with Treehopper (unless you wish to use cellular phone/data service, obviously). 

While we don't warrant or certify specific hosts, here are some devices we've used:

## ASUS Google Nexus 7
These Android Lollipop-enabled devices are relatively snappy for their age. We routinely see used Nexus 7 devices on eBay in the $40 price range.

## Moto E (2nd Generation)
These phones are sold as both carrier-locked and unlocked devices, and are also popular with prepaid plans. We've seen them new in the ~$20 range (Tracfone), but unlocked versions go for $65 new or so. On the used market, they're often less than $30.

## Generic Android Set-Top Boxes
If you don't need portability, there are tons of sub-$30 Android set-top boxes on popular sites like Amazon and eBay. These boxes can be *very* slow for their stated purposes (Netflix, gaming) but quite usable for simple Treehopper apps. Many of them have awkward launchers designed for display on a television (and a remote control as the sole input).

# iOS Support? {#ios}
Unfortunately, Treehopper cannot be used with Apple iPhones or iPads. This is less of a technical limitation with iOS, but more a legal/licensure issue that relates to the MFi (Made for iOS) program. Apple does not allow arbitrary iOS apps to connect to hardware over the Lightning connector -- so while Treehopper Electronics could theoretically certify Treehopper as an MFi device, only Treehopper Electronics could publish iOS apps that connect to the device, which wouldn't be useful for the Treehopper developer community.

# Native Development {#native-development}
