class TreehopperUsb:
    """The core class for communicating with Treehopper USB boards.

    ![Treehopper pinout](images/treehopper-hardware.svg)

    Core hardware
    =============
    %Treehopper is a USB 2.0 Full Speed device with 20 \link pin.Pin Pins\endlink â€” each of which can be used as an
    analog input, digital input, digital output, or soft-PWM output. Many of these pins also have dedicated peripheral
    functions for \link spi.HardwareSpi SPI\endlink, \link i2c.HardwareI2C I2C\endlink,\link uart.HardwareUart
    UART\endlink, and \link pwm.HardwarePwm PWM\endlink.

    You'll access all the pins, peripherals, and board functions through this class, which will automatically create
    all peripheral instances for you.

    Example:
        >>> board = find_boards()[0]        # Get the first board.
        >>> board.connect()                 # Be sure to connect before doing anything else.
        >>> board.led = True                # Turn on the board's LED.
        >>> imu = Mpu9250.probe(board.i2c)  # Connect an MPU9250 9-DoF IMU to the I2C interface on the board.
        >>> print(imu.accelerometer)        # Print the acceleration reading from the sensor.
        '[0.95, 0.01, 0.03]'
        >>> board.disconnect()              # Disconnect from the board when finished.

    Getting a board reference
    -------------------------
    To obtain a reference to the board, use the \link treehopper.api.find_boards.find_boards() find_boards()\endlink
    method:

        >>> board = find_boards()[0]        # Get the first board.

    \warning While you're free to create TreehopperUsb variables that reference boards, do not attempt to create a
    TreehopperUsb instance manually; always obtain references to boards from the \link
    treehopper.api.find_boards.find_boards() find_boards()\endlink function.

    Connect to the board
    --------------------
    Before you use the board, you must explicitly connect to it by calling the connect() method

        >>> board = find_boards()[0]        # Get the first board.
        >>> board.connect()                 # Be sure to connect before
        doing anything else.

    \note Once a board is connected, other applications won't be able to use it.

    On-board LED
    ------------
    The only peripheral directly exposed by this class is the #led property, which will control the LED's state once
    the board is connected. This demo will blink the LED until the board is unplugged:

        >>> board = find_boards()[0]
        >>> board.connect()
        >>> while board.connected:
        >>>     board.led = not board.led  # toggle the LED
        >>>     sleep(0.1)
